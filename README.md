# adventofcode2018
These are my, [Niklas Hallqvist](https://github.com/niklasha) solutions to
[Advent of code 2018](https://adventofcode.com/2018).
They are written in [Scala](https://scala-lang.org) using the
[ScalaTest](http://scalatest.org) testing framework.

My reason for doing these are, besides the fact that I like puzzle solving, I want to improve my Scala skills even more.

You need Scala, [sbt](https://scala-sbt.org), ScalaTest and of course
a [Java](https://java.com) runtime installed to run the tests, but that is about it.

Run all the days with:
```
sbt test
```

or a specific day with:
```
sbt "testOnly se.hallqvist.adventofcode2018.day1.*"
```
